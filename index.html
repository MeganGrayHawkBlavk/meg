            <h2>🍩<u>About Me</u> 🍩</h2>
            <p>I am a quiet, focused person who can work swiftly and effectively either alone or as part of a team.<br>
                I
                have the ability to work under stress and keep within set budgets and targets. <br>
                I am open minded,
                receptive and innovative, with an enquiring mind. <br>
                I delight in joking around, but I'm quick to learn
                and willing to adapt to any position,
                and <br>
                also able to communicate well with people from all walks of life.
            </p>
            🦇
            <p>In my time when I'm not at work, I enjoy movies, musicals, comic books and arcade games.
                <br>I adore bleaching and adding color to hair. Whatever color you want, I will do it, just for fun!
                <br>I love using tools to create art with anything I can get my paws on, such as
                <br>woodworking, amateur photography, gardening, drawing, painting, clay ceramics, and beading, etc.
                <br>I dabble in American Indigenous History and Geology.
                <br> Halloween is my favorite time of the year and all things extra spooky!
            </p>
            👩🏽‍🎨
            <p>I have a large family with 6 sisters and 4 brothers, so I am number 2 of 11 siblings.
                <br> I also have many nieces and nephews.
                <br>I have one almost adult daughter, Arielle, and 1 young god daughter, Lola.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Of course, I can't forget my 4 lovely cats.
                <br>Their names are Sprinkles, Posie, Geni, and Honey.
