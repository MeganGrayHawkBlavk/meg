        <h2>💙 <u>Kunbarrasaurus</u> 💙</h2>
        <p>This scaley guy was up to almost 12 feet long, and only a little over 2ft high.<br>
            He had a flat skull roof, a parrot-like beak, and a large opening around the nostril. <br>This little cutie fed on berries, seeds, nuts tree branches.<br> He seems like a large vegetarian doggo!<br>
            I would love to bring him on my Cave Woman Journey.  </p>

        <h2>💙 <u>Kronosaurus</u> 💙</h2>
        <p>He was a large pliosaur, a type of aquatic reptile, that grew to be about 29.5 to 36 feet long.<br> Its skull alone was about 12.1 feet long.Kronosaurus had a short neck, large head, <br>and four large fins for swimming. Its front teeth were larger than the back teeth, and its large cone-shaped teeth were used to crush the shells<br> of ammonites and other prey. This vicious sea beast was carnivore that hunted larger fish, <br>invertebrates, and other tasty reptiles. Some scientists suggest they these monsters <br>went on land to lay eggs like turtles.
